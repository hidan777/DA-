The visualization reveals that a total of 829K crime cases have been documented. The majority of these incidents occurred on the streets, with strong-arm tactics being the most common method of attack, including the use of hands, fists, feet, or bodily force.

From 2020 to 2022, there was a steady rise in crime. However, in 2023, a decrease was observed, likely due to the data being available only up until October 30, 2023. The ‘Report-Event Discrepancy’ graph shows a decreasing trend in the gap between the occurrence of a crime and its reporting, with an average delay of 4 days.

Crimes are most likely to occur in the afternoon, accounting for 26.63% of incidents, and least likely to occur at dawn, accounting for 13.86% of incidents.

A significant 80% of crime cases are still under investigation, with only 8% leading to an arrest. Over the years, males have been the most common victims, accounting for around 42-39% of cases, followed by other genders. Lastly, the areas in Los Angeles with the highest crime rates are Central, 77th Street, and Pacific.
