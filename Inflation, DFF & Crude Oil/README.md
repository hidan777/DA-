This Data Analysis project is about examining the trends of U.S. Inflation, DFF (Federal Funds Rate), and Crude Oil. 

The data is sourced from the following: 
- [U.S. Crude Oil](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_sum_snd_a_ep00_mbbl_m_cur.htm)
- [DFF](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF)
- [Inflation](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/)

The process involves several steps:

* Data Transformation
  
The main purpose of data transformation is to combine the three datasets and calculate the growth for analysis purposes. We use Jupyter Notebook for Python. The steps are: 
1. [Transform the 3 datasets](https://github.com/hidan777/DA-/blob/main/Inflation%2C%20DFF%20%26%20Crude%20Oil/OIL%2C%20Inflation%20%26%20DFF%20Transform.ipynb)
2. [Calculate the growth of indicators](https://github.com/hidan777/DA-/blob/main/Inflation%2C%20DFF%20%26%20Crude%20Oil/Growth%20Transform.ipynb)

* Data Visualization 

We will then visualize the transformed data to better understand the trends and patterns..

The data above explains about US inflation, the US Federal Funds Effective Rate (DFF), and U.S. crude oil trends. The US Federal Funds Effective Rate (DFF) is the interest rate determined by the Federal Reserve (the FED). Several Crude oil indicators consist of Ending Stock, Field Production, Export and Import of Crude Oil.

This data was last updated in August 2023, with inflation at 3.7%, DFF at 5.33%, Ending Stock of crude oil at 768K (thousand barrels), import of crude oil at 218K (thousand barrels), field production of crude oil at 405k (thousand barrels), exports of crude oil at 128k (thousand barrels).

it's Interesting to observe that after 2020, inflation increased rapidly alongside a decline in crude oil stocks. This could potentially have been a result of the impact of COVID-19.

Observing the trends, there has been a decrease in crude oil imports from 2010 until now. This is in stark contrast to the crude oil exports and production, where exports have seen an increase since 2017 and production has been on the rise from 2010 onwards. Notably, in 2023, the U.S. crude oil stocks plummeted to their lowest level since 2005.

Over a 10-year period, the Federal Funds Effective Rate (DFF) and US Crude Oil Exports saw significant growth of 6562.50% and 5757.03% respectively, while US Crude Oil Production remained stable. Meanwhile, US Crude Oil Imports and Ending Stocks decreased. US inflation fluctuated, with a notable increase of 146.67%. This data highlights the intricate dynamics between various economic factors and the energy industry.
